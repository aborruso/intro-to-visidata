To save your current sheet to a **file**, press :kbd:`Control-s`. VisiData will prompt you with a suggested filename, which you can edit. Once you're satisfied, press :kbd:`Enter`.

You can also save your sheet (or just the selected rows) to your **system clipboard** by typing :kbd:`gY` and following the prompt.
